## Discussions

### November 11th via Phone

- Anthony does not mind having these notes publicly attributed to himself
- The restaurant building is uniquely old and physically is not laid out well to continuously produce orders for takeout
- The restaurant is very busy on weekends with week days being quieter
- The restaurant has had recent issues with finding enough staffing
- Anthony believes there are a handful of advantages with using third-party delivery services, namely:
  - signup is easy
  - creating the online menu listing is easy
  - free advertisting
  - kept business going during pandemic
- The restaurant opted to stay open and deliver food with the delivery services in order to keep their staff employed, lest they get picked up by other places and not be able to return to work post-pandemic
- Despite the positives, Anthony believed there were many negatives and they outweighed the advantages for Manory's case, namely:
  - fees on each order are incredibly high (40%+ at times)
  - after service fees and restaurant's own food and labor costs, the restaurant might make a measly 5% on an order which is simply not sustainable
    - meat prices are currently skyrocketing as well
  - did not work well for Manory's as ironically there is too much business to handle coming in from multiple streams
  - the restaurant prioritizes in-house orders and therefore online orders sometimes get delayed
  - Manory's food also isn't the most deliverable (breakfast foods)
  - as a small business, they are stuck paying full fees to these services whereas chains are able to negotiate lower fees
  - online orders tend to come in with extreme, costly customizations that are difficult to get right
  - mistakes in making orders are harshly punished by unfair reviews
  - when there is a mistake in an order, there are typically three options for a restaurant:
    1. replace food - preferred but impractical with delivery
    2. compensate for price of order - restaurant loses food AND money, **default option for online orders**
    3. do nothing - customer gets irate and leaves bad review
  - delivery drivers get frustrated with the wait times from prioritizing in-house orders
- Anthony shared Manory's experience with the main services:
  - GrubHub was easy to set up with but charged ridiculous fees (40%+)
  - DoorDash listed Manory's without their knowledge and forwarded orders by phone call
    - This was perceived as a positive as Manory's was not paying a fee on orders received
    - After 3 months, however, DoorDash contacted Manory's and demanded payment to continue to be listed on their platform
    - After Manory's refused, it was delisted until being relisted a few months later with the cycle repeating
  - UberEats was deemded the worst, as they demanded a large fee to even start listing on their platform
  - Mealeo was preferred as it is a local company and is slightly more amenable with fees
    - Anthony said he also felt better about paying fees to a local business over a massive, impersonal company
- **Overall, Anthony believed the delivery services were necessary to keep the lights on during the pandemic but were too costly and unncessary once in-person dining returned.**
  - Anthony suggested that a platform would need to take fees of **10% or less** in order for Manory's to deem it feasible
  - New businesses that don't have loyal customers might benefit from using the services for publicity but might suffer from the fees and harsh user reviews
  - Manory's doesn't need to extra avenues for orders as they are already typically busy
  - Pizza/chinese food industry is better suited for delivery than diners/cafes
- Lastly, Anthony mentioned that since alcohol typically has a relatively much higher profit margin than most food items, having that available on a platform is a huge plus
