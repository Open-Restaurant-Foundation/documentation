# Non Profits

## Overview

Organizations that don't aim to make profit but instead offer valuable services to communities can be rewarded with being tax-exempt, if they adhere to the very strict [501(c)(3)](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exemption-requirements-501c3-organizations) requirements.

## Types of 501(c)(3) Nonprofits (Foundation Status)

### Public Charities
- Most common and well-known form of nonprofit
- governed by board of directors
- expected to received most funding through fundraisers and donations
- examples include churches, religious institutions, animal welfare agencies and educational organizations
- donators can donate up to 50% of income before being taxed
- must meet exceptions to the private foundation rules to be considered public charities
  - "To be classified as a public charity – not a private foundation – an organization has to be one of the specific types of organizations named in the Code, like a hospital or church; OR show that it has broad public support; OR show a combination of broad public support and income from its exempt activities; OR have a special relationship with another public charity."

### Private Foundations (AKA Non-operating Foundations)
- does not have active programs
- usually funded by individual or family
- often donate to other nonprofits or individuals for the same mission
- more strictly regulated and are subject to a number of anti-abuse rules and excise taxes that don’t apply to public charities
- examples include family foundations
- donators can only donate up to 30% of income before being taxed

### Private Operating Foundations
- least common type of nonprofit
- similar to private foundations but have active programs
- aren't regulated as closely as public charities
- donators can only donate up to 30% of income before being taxed
